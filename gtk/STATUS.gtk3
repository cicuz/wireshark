Status of the GTK+ 3 port :
===========================

$Id$

Take a look at the "Migrating from GTK+ 2.x to GTK+ 3" document at:
http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/gtk-migrating-2-to-3.html

There are two ways to make the Wireshark code gtk3 ready:

1) CMake and configure options to build with gtk3 instead of gtk2:
  cmake:     ENABLE_GTK3=ON
  configure: --with-gtk3
  This will only work if building without gtkvumeter.c
  and rtp_player.c (disable portaudio). It also requires GTK3 to be installed.
  GTK3 is available for Windows as a mingw build only, see
  http://lists-archives.org/gtk-devel/13233-fwd-precompiled-gtk3-for-windows.html

2) The compat flags in GTK2:
  -DGTK_DISABLE_SINGLE_INCLUDES [works and is enabled]
  -DGSEAL_ENABLE [works and is enabled]
  -DGDK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED [works for most files and is enabled, see below]
  -DGTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED [works for most files and is enabled, see below]

A large part of the GTK3 porting work as been done.

The following files will not yet compile either with GTK2 and GxK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED
or GDK3/GTK3 or have code in them to disable functionality in order to be able to build:
    gtkvumeter.c (windows only, fails, still using deprecated functions.)
    rtp_player.c (fails, still using GdkPixmap)
    proto_help.c (not ported to UI-MANAGER)
    funnel_stat.c (?) (the lua menu items fail at runtime)
plus maybe some other code that is outside the tested #ifdef combinations.

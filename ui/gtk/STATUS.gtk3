Status of the GTK+ 3 port :
===========================

$Id$

The port is done. We used the methods described in the "Migrating from
GTK+ 2.x to GTK+ 3" document at:
http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/gtk-migrating-2-to-3.html

To build Wireshark with GTK3 instead of GTK2, use:

  - cmake:     ENABLE_GTK3=ON
  - configure: --with-gtk3
  This will only work if building without gtkvumeter.c (which is used on Windows
  only and only in the WLAN code). It also requires GTK3 to be installed.
  GTK3 is available for Windows as a mingw build, see
  http://lists-archives.org/gtk-devel/13233-fwd-precompiled-gtk3-for-windows.html
  A Win32 port is in the making (and availalbe as source):
  http://blogs.gnome.org/alexl/2011/11/25/gtk-work-on-windows/
  The location of an experimental build can be found at:
  http://www.pguridi.com.ar/2011/10/experimental-gtk-3-3-2-win32-build/

Except in one place we are building on GTK2 using the compat flags
  -DGTK_DISABLE_SINGLE_INCLUDES
  -DGSEAL_ENABLE
  -DGDK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED [works everywhere except tcp_graph.h]
  -DGTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED

Summary: The only known files that cause some sort of problems (or lost
         functionality) are:
  - gtkvumeter.c (removed, only used for wlan on windows)
  - proto_help.c (not ported to UI-MANAGER)
  - tcp_graph.c (does not compile with GTK2 and GDK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED)
